# Anti-AutoTranslation-List
List for uBlock Origin (and possibly other adblockers), containing auto-translated site clones of StackOverflow and other services. Also, rules could be imported into some search filtering extension (at least [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/personal-blocklist/) works).

Add this link (better **with** "?" symbol to avoid caching issues) to your filter list:

Feel free to suggest other resources like this via pull request or issues!
