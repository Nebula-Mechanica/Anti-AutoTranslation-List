# Anti-AutoTranslation-List
List for uBlock Origin (and possibly other adblockers), containing auto-translated site clones of StackOverflow and other services.
Now have support for hiding urls in search results (Google, DuckDuckGo and Startpage for now) without any special extensions!

Add this link to your adblocker filter list:

If you don't want CSS-based search filtering:
